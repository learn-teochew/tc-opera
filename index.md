title: Learn Teochew with Teochew Opera
---

Teochew Opera has a rich tradition and is one of the most famous art forms
associated with Teochew language and culture. As a heritage speaker of Teochew,
I found it fascinating but also very intimidating, because the language used in
Teochew opera is different from everyday vernacular language, and it seemed too
difficult to understand for a beginner. One reason is that opera shows often do
not have subtitles, and when they do, the subtitles are translations into
Mandarin and do not fit the Teochew words exactly.

These pages will focus on producing resources helpful for learning Teochew
language from Teochew opera. This means:
 * Transcriptions into Pêng’im (romanized phonetic spelling) and Chinese
   characters
 * Translations into English
 * Explanatory notes on vocabulary and spelling conventions (e.g. non-standard
   characters, unique Teochew vocabulary or grammar)

In addition I would like to showcase the centuries-old history of Teochew
vernacular writing in Teochew opera scripts. These historical scripts are among
the rare examples of Chinese regional languages (“dialects”) in printed form
that have survived to the present day. Some of these rare editions have been
digitized and can be read online. I have linked those that I know about from
this page.

Finally, many modern Teochew opera performances can be viewed online. Some
YouTube channels with Teochew opera content are also linked here.

Pêng’im transcriptions and English translations by Learn Teochew
----------------------------------------------------------------

To help Teochew learners who are curious about the language used in Teochew
opera, we will be transcribing selected operas and excerpts into Pêng’im and
translating them to English. These translations are for educational purposes
only. Transcriptions are in the three most popular romanization systems:
Guangdong Education Department Pêng’im (1960), Gaginang.org Peng’im, and the
[Tie-tsiann-hue Tie-lo system](http://teochew.pw). PDFs are also provided for
offline reading.

Historical Teochew opera scripts
--------------------------------

Five of the editions below are reprinted in a facsimile edition,
《明本潮州戲文五種》（廣東人民出版社，1985）. Because two of these editions
each contain two different plays printed together, a total of seven plays are
included in this facsimile reprint. Fortunately for those of us who are unable
to find a copy of this valuable edition, several of them are now available as
digitized versions online. In some cases, the digital scans are in color and of
high quality, capturing more detail than the printed facsimile edition.
