![](cion-he-opera.png){:width="25%" style="float:left; padding:15px"} Teochew
Opera has a rich tradition and is one of the most famous art forms associated
with Teochew language and culture. As a heritage speaker of Teochew, I found it
fascinating but also very intimidating, because the language used in Teochew
opera is different from everyday vernacular language, and it seemed too
difficult to understand for a beginner.



This website focuses on providing resources to help you learn Teochew from
Teochew opera, including phonetic transcriptions with Teochew Pêng’im,
translations, and explanatory notes.
