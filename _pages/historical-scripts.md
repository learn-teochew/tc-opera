title: Historical Teochew Opera Scripts
permalink: /historical-scripts
---

The history of Teochew vernacular writing goes back at least five hundred
years. We know this because of historical Teochew opera scripts (劇本
*giah-bung*) that have survived to the present day. These scripts are rare
examples of Chinese regional languages (“dialects”) in written or printed form.
Some of these books have been digitized and can be read online. However they
can be difficult to read because they are laid out very differently from modern
books and playscripts. The written language is also unfamiliar to most modern
readers, because there are many variant or simplified characters, as well as
vocabulary and grammar not found in Mandarin or literary Chinese.

Here we will list the historical editions and any reprints, digitizations, or
transcriptions that we are aware of, and also provide a short explainer on how
to read these texts.

List of historical Teochew opera scripts
----------------------------------------

Historical opera scripts include both hand-written manuscripts and printed
books. These must have been popular and widely circulated because they were
commercially printed and sold to the public. However, only a few examples
survive today, mostly in collections outside of China.

Five of the editions below have been reprinted in a facsimile edition,
《明本潮州戲文五種》(*Five Teochew opera scripts from the Ming era*,
广东人民出版社, 1985). Because two of these editions each contain two different
plays printed together, there is a total of seven plays. Fortunately for those
of us who are unable to find a copy of this valuable reprint, several of them
are now available as digitized versions online, which are linked below where
available. In some cases, the digital scans are in color and of high quality,
capturing more detail than the printed facsimile.

The Taiwanese scholar Wu Shouli [吳守禮](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/吳守禮)
has published critical editions of Minnan opera works, including some of the
works listed below.

### 《劉希必金釵記》 • *Lau-hi-bik Gim-toi-gi* • *Tale of the Golden Hairpin*

Manuscript, dated year 6 of the Ming Xuande 宣德 era (1431), recovered in an
archaeological excavation in 1975. In the collection of the Teochew Municipal
Museum.

Scholarly edition with extensive introductory chapters:

### 《蔡伯皆》 • *Cua Bêh-gai*

Manuscript dated to the Ming Jiajing 嘉靖 era (1521-1567), recovered in an
archaeological excavation in 1958. In the collection of the Guangdong
Provincial Museum.

Photographic reproduction in 《明本潮州戲文五種》.


### 《荔鏡記》 • *Li-gian-gi* • *Tale of the Lychee and Mirror*

This opera is also known as 《荔枝記》 *Li-gi-gi*, “*Tale of the Lychee
Branch*”.  The modern opera 《陳三五娘》 *Dang-san Ngou-niê* is based on the
same story.  The story is partly set in Quanzhou 泉州 (Tsuann-tsiu) and Teochew
prefectures, and a version is also performed in Quanzhou / Hokkien opera. As a
result, this opera has also been claimed as part of the heritage of
Hokkien-language opera, and is one of the “Four Great Works” of Taiwanese
歌仔戲 *kua-á-hì* opera.

Several historical editions have been rediscovered, suggesting that this was a
popular story, frequently adapted and re-printed. The oldest known editions are
from 1566 (below, left) and 1581 (below, right).

#### Ming Jiajing 嘉靖 version of 《荔镜记》 (1566)

Full title:《重刊五色潮泉插科增入詩詞北曲勾欄荔鏡記戲曲全集》Published in year
45 of the Ming Jiajing 嘉靖 era (1566). There are two known copies, one in the
Bodleian Library of Oxford University, the other in the Tenri Library, Japan.
The Bodleian copy was rediscovered in the 1930s by Xiang Da 向達.

This version is a mixture of Quanzhou 泉州 (Tsuann-tsiu) and Teochew source
editions. The text is printed together with excerpts from a Minnan play
《顏臣》 *Hian-cing*, and excerpts and arias from other plays; the *Li-gian-gi*
text is in the lower register of each page.

### 《蘇六娘》 • Sou Lag-niê • Sixth Lady Sou

Probably printed during the Ming Wanli 萬曆 era (1572-1620).  The text was
printed together with another Teochew play 《金花女》 *Gim-huê-neng* in the
same volume (see below).  The text of *Sou Lag-niê* is in the upper register of
each page, whereas *Gim-huê-neng* is in the lower register. The volume was
formerly in the collection of Nagasawa Kikuya 長澤規矩也, and is now preserved
in Tokyo University (source of the image below).

![First page of the combined edition of Gim-hue-nvng (below) and Sou-lak nie (above)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/images/gim-hue-nvng-sou-lak-nie-page.png %}){:width="40%" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

This historical edition contains a selection of eleven scenes from the play, so
there are some logical gaps in the story. The modern opera of the same name is
based on the same story, which has a similar theme as *Dang-san Ngou-niê*, and
is also still one of the most popular Teochew operas.

How to read historical opera scripts
----------------------------------------

The printed opera scripts were printed and thread-bound in the traditional way.
In woodblock printing, an entire sheet of paper is printed from a single carved
block. After a sheet is printed, it is folded in half with the printed side
facing outwards, resulting in two adjacent pages. A stack of folded sheets is
then sandwiched between covers and sewn with thread on the open edges to make a
threadbound volume (線裝).

To read these books, you will need some knowledge of Teochew, as well as how
the content is laid out and organized on the page:

 * How the pages are formatted (layout)
 * How the different stage roles and directions are indicated
 * What simplified and non-standard Chinese characters are used

The example pages here are from the Ming Jiajing edition (1566) of the
《荔鏡記》 *Li-gian-gi*, from a digital scan of the Bodleian copy. This edition
was published at Jianyang 建陽 in Fujian 福建 province, which was an important
center for commercial publishing in the Ming and Qing.

### Page layout

Like most traditional Chinese books, the text is in vertical lines, arranged
from right to left.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/images/historical_opera_script_1.png %}){:width="80%" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

The content on this page is in three horizontal blocks: a smaller “upper
register” 上欄 of text (top), illustrations 插圖 (middle), and a larger “lower
register” 下欄 of text (bottom). Actually, this volume contains two different
works: 《荔鏡記》*Li-gian-gi* in the lower register and selections from another
play 《彥臣》 *Ngang-cing* in the upper register. Bundling popular works
together was a common practice by publishers to make the books more attractive
to buyers. However not all books are like this: for example, the 1581
《荔枝記》 *Li-gi-gi* has only one text register and illustrations.

### Headings, roles and stage directions

Each scene or act usually has a numbered heading, followed by a title. Here the
heading is surrounded by a thick bracket: 【第七出】燈下搭歌 “Scene 7 – joining
in song under the lanterns”.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/images/historical_opera_script_2.png %}){:width="80%" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

Operas are mixtures of sung and spoken parts. The melody is referred to by
name〔大迓鼓〕and surrounded by brackets or otherwise highlighted. The same
melodies were used between different operas, just with different words. Many of
the melodies in the *Li-gian-gi* are still preserved today in the *Lam-gueng*
南管 musical tradition.

This is followed by the stage direction 旦占丑上, meaning that the actors
playing the roles of 旦 *duan* (female lead), 貼 *tiêb* (female second lead,
this book uses the simplified character 占), and 丑 *tiu* (clown) come on
stage. Unlike modern scripts, the characters are not referred to by name but by
the actor’s role.

In the Ming era there were seven main roles:

 * 生 *sêng* - Male lead
 * 旦 *duan* - Female lead
 * 貼 *tiêb* - Female second lead
 * 外 *ghua* - Old person
 * 丑 *tiu* - Clown
 * 末 *bhuah* - Middle-aged person
 * 淨 *zêng* - Painted-face

In modern times this has been simplified to four main roles: 生、旦、淨、丑,
but each can be subdivided further (e.g. 小生、老生……).

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/images/historical_opera_script_3.png %}){:width="80%" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

The sung parts are printed with full-width characters, whereas spoken parts are
printed half-width.

### Teochew vocabulary and non-standard characters

Teochew has different vocabulary and grammar from Mandarin or literary Chinese.
Although the language used in opera has more literary influence, there are
still Teochew/Minnan words or phrases that are not found in Mandarin.

In the excerpt below there are Teochew/Minnan words such as 冥昏 *mê-hng*
“evening”, 值方 *di-huang* “where?”, and 今旦 *gim-dan* “today”.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/images/historical_opera_script_4.png %}){:width="80%" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

Commercially printed books often used simplified characters because of the
expense of block carving. For example, 呵𭑧 is a simplified form of 阿娘
*a-niê* “Miss”. Such simplified characters were common in handwriting and
printed books, although not in official or scholarly publications. Some of were
adopted as official simplified characters in the 20th century, but many may be
unfamiliar to modern readers.

The iteration mark, which looks like the character 匕, means that the previous
characters are to be repeated, much like “ditto” in English.
