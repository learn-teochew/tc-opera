title: Historical Teochew Opera Scripts
permalink: /historical-scripts
---

There is a centuries-old history of Teochew vernacular writing in Teochew opera
scripts. These historical scripts are among the rare examples of Chinese
regional languages (“dialects”) in printed form that have survived to the
present day. Some of these rare editions have been digitized and can be read
online. However it can be difficult to decipher these texts because they are
laid out very differently from modern books and playscripts. The written
language is also likely to be unfamiliar to most people who read Chinese,
because there are many variant or simplified characters, as well as vocabulary
and grammar not found in Mandarin or literary Chinese.

Original editions
-----------------

Five of the editions below have been reprinted in a facsimile edition,
《明本潮州戲文五種》（廣東人民出版社，1985）. Because two of these editions
each contain two different plays printed together, a total of seven plays were
included in this edition. Fortunately for those of us who are unable to find a
copy of this valuable book, several of them are now available as digitized
versions online. In some cases, the digital scans are in color and of high
quality, capturing more detail than the printed facsimile.


### 《劉希必金釵記》 • Lau-hi-bik Gim-toi-gi • Tale of the Golden Hairpin

Published 1431, recovered in an archaeological excavation in 1975. In the
collection of the Teochew Municipal Museum. Reprinted in 《明本潮州戲文五種》.


### 《蔡伯皆》 • Cua Bêh-gai

Published in the Jiajing 嘉靖 era (1521-1567), recovered in an archaeological
excavation in 1958. In the collection of the Guangdong Provincial Museum.
Reprinted in 《明本潮州戲文五種》.


### 《荔鏡記》 • Li-gian-gi • Tale of the Lychee Mirror

This opera is also known as 《荔枝記》 *Li-gi-gi*, “Tale of the Lychee Branch”.
The modern opera 《陳三五娘》 *Dang-san Ngou-niê* is based on the same story.
The story is partly set in 泉州 Tsuann-tsiu and Teochew, and a version is also
performed in Tsuann-tsiu / Hokkien opera. As a result, this opera has also been
claimed as part of the heritage of Hokkien-language opera, and is one of the
“Four Great Works” of Taiwanese 歌仔戲 kua-á-hì opera.

Several historical editions have been rediscovered, suggesting that this was a
popular story, frequently adapted and re-printed.

   *Li-gian-gi* text is in the lower register of each page. Reprinted in

### 《蘇六娘》 • Sou Lag-niê • Sixth Lady Sou

Probably printed during the Ming Wanli era (1572-1620). Reprinted in
《明本潮州戲文五種》. The text was printed together with another Teochew play
《金花女》 *Gim-huê-neng* in the same volume (see below). The text of *Sou
Lag-niê* is in the upper register of each page, whereas *Gim-huê-neng* was in
the lower register. The volume was formerly in the collection of Nagasawa
Kikuya 長澤規矩也, and is now preserved in Tokyo University.

This historical edition contains a selection of eleven scenes from the play, so
there are some logical gaps in the story. The modern opera of the same name is
based on the same story, which has a similar theme as *Dang-san Ngou-niê*, and
is also still one of the most popular Teochew operas.
