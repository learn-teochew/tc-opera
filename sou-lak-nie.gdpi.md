> This version of the opera cuts off this scene at the seventh month. In other versions, to-huê and the boatman continue taking turns until the boatman begins with the “thirteenth month” and loses the competition because there is no thirteenth month (see Helga Werle, [“Notes on Chiuchow Opera”](https://hkjo.lib.hku.hk/archive/files/64866eb4532f430fb6285a712a08d768.pdf), *J. Royal Asiatic Soc. Hong Kong Branch* (1975) vol. 15, pp. 71-87).
>
> Werle writes of this scene: “This is a most delightful scene, a fully choreographed dance with the music based on Chiuchow [Teochew] folk tunes. The music and the dance are fresh and cheerful. This opening shows characteristic features of Chiuchow opera; it is beautiful, lighthearted and full of songs and dances.”
